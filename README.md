# CPU-Scheduler-Console
CPU Scheduling Simulator - includes FCFS, SJF, RR, Priority, SRTF, MLFQ
# CPU Scheduling Simulator - CS 3502 Project 2

## Overview
This project is a CPU scheduling simulator built in C# (Console Application) for CS 3502 at Kennesaw State University. It implements six scheduling algorithms:

- First Come, First Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Priority Scheduling
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) (New)
- Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) (New)

It measures and compares performance metrics:
- Average Waiting Time (AWT)
- Average Turnaround Time (ATT)
- CPU Utilization (%)
- Throughput (Processes/sec)

## How to Build and Run

1. Open the project folder in Visual Studio (or VS Code with C# extension).
2. Build the solution.
3. Run the program. 
4. The simulator will prompt you to select a scheduling algorithm and input processes.

## Running Tests
You can either:
- Hardcode small test process sets inside the `Program.cs`
- Or modify the console to accept runtime user input (optional enhancement).
